'''
This file will uses scikit learn to create a Linear regression model on the The advertising dataset, dataset which captures the sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement costs across multiple channels like radio, tv, and newspapers.

It is required to understand the impact of ad budgets on the overall sales.

Dataset Features:
    -Id: The Id table listed in ascending order
    -TV ad Budget: Amonut spent on TV advertisments
    -Radio ad Budget Amount spent on radio advertisment
    -Newspaper ad Budget column: Amount to be spent on Newespaper advert
    -Sales column: The target Feature of the dataset, showing a relationship between the different advertisment budgets and their expected reveue on Sales
